# FootballManager AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

iFootballManager AI helps football managers and enthusiasts manage a team on a budget. It identifies undervalued players who outperform their market value and helps maximize team performance while staying within a budget. It provides recommendations tailored to teams that can't compete financially with giants like Manchester City.


## Background
Football clubs with limited budgets often struggle to compete with wealthier teams. This project aims to provide tools to identify undervalued talent and optimize squad quality within financial constraints.

*The challenge of scouting and identifying undervalued talent.

*The difficulty of optimizing player quality within budget constraints.

*Empowering smaller teams to compete strategically.

As an football enthusiast, I want to create a tool that levels the playing field for smaller clubs, encouraging smarter team-building strategies and making football management more accessible.


## How is it used?
This solution simplifies football team management by analyzing data and providing actionable insights. It is designed for both professionals and enthusiasts.

Users input:

*Team budget

*Required player positions

*Existing squad composition

*Preferred playing style (e.g., high pressing, possession-based)

The AI outputs:

*A list of recommended players with high performance-to-value ratios.

*Analysis of how the recommended players fit into the teamâ€™s tactical needs.

*Predictions for potential team performance improvements.

This solution is ideal for:

*Football managers of smaller clubs.

*Football enthusiasts playing management simulation games.

*Real-life analysts looking for quick, data-driven insights.

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

## Data sources and AI methods
The project relies on high-quality data and advanced AI techniques to generate valuable insights and predictions.

*Player performance data from sources like FBref or Opta.

*Transfer market data from Transfermarkt.

*Machine learning techniques:

*Regression models to estimate player market value.

*Clustering to identify similar players.

*Optimization algorithms for squad building within a budget.


## Challenges
While the project provides significant advantages, it is important to recognize its limitations.

*Account for subjective factors like player mentality or team chemistry.

*Handle real-time market fluctuations during transfer windows.

*Guarantee performance consistency due to injuries or external factors.

*The quality of predictions depends on the accuracy and availability of player data.

*Smaller datasets for lower leagues may result in less accurate recommendations.


## What next?
The project has significant potential for growth and could be expanded to become even more impactful.
*Adding support for more leagues and competitions.

*Integrating real-time match performance updates.

*Developing a user-friendly app for fans and managers.

*Partnering with football analytics companies for broader adoption.
